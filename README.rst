# ACNE VIZ

ACNE VIZ is a plotting library built on Matplotlib. It's goal is not to be a general
purpose plotting library, but to provide easy access to good looking graphs for client
presentations following a consistent visual identity.

One of the core design decisions is that it is only there to plot already wrangled data.
The library performs no data wrangling on it's own.
